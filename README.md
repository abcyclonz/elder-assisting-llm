. Our project addresses this by fine-tuning a generative dialogue model on elder-specific data and augmenting it with memory modules to maintain personalization over long-term conversations. The system is built to remember personal details (via a JSON-profile and LTM) and to draw on past context when generating responses (via RAG), aiming to emulate human-like care and consistency
